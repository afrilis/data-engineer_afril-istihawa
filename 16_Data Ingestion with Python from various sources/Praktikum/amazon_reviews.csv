5.0,"Comfortable, sturdy, and folds up nice and easy. I originally bought these to have extra seating that is sturdy enough for heavier guests. Everyone who has sat in these are full of compliments on how comfortable and sturdy they are. Also light and compact enough to easily put in the trunk/carry to use at different events.

3.0,"The chairs themselves are on the small side and close to the ground. Aesthetically pleasing and very easy to store. They say they hold up to 330lbs which was why I went for the purchase being that I am plus size. Unfortunately they are very uncomfortable borderline painful to sit on. They “hold” a lot of weight but are very narrow and pinch. The cushion is barely anything almost just a cover really. Good for smaller adults both in size and height but for those looking for comfy chairs for guest on the heavier side I’d pass.

1.0,"This chair was advertised as heavy duty with a 400lb capacity -- not even close.  I am 6'3"" and close to 400 lbs...  there is no way I could sit in it...  too small and close to the ground.  It was perfect for my petite wife who is a 100+ lbs.  Not recommended for a big person!

5.0,"These chairs are awesome! They are good for all size people.  The table tray is handy and sturdy and we can wash the cushions easily.  Win win in our RV!

4.0,"I like the chairs although pricey, it was worth getting the 2 pack. I like they fold flat instead of the traditional camp chairs that get uncomfortable after prolonged sitting. I like the height I'm short, but they seem to be of a normal height and are not low like a beach chair. The legs are very stable and I don't feel like im going to tip over in it.  The padded covers are removable and washable when needed, they could have been filled with more fluff but other than that they do the job

2.0,"Very disappointed in the cheap too small cushions these chairs came with. It's too much trouble to return, I tried to cancel the order before they were shipped but sadly the wheels were in motion. Don't bother

3.0,"I am a plus size woman(330) and bought these for their weight capacity.  I found them very uncomfortable. Too narrow for my big butt and the cushion raises you almost within a couple inches of the top of the wood arms. The chairs are visually pretty and the cushion is comfortable,  but the material catches lint like crazy! For people under 200 pounds these would be great chairs.
